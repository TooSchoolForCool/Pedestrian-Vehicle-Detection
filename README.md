# UG-Capstone

This repo is my undergrad capstone project, which is a Vehicle & Pedestrian Detection system and is the vision module for an Advanced Driver Assistance System(ADAS).

This system performed its vehicle/pedestrian detection processes using a single camera mounted at the front of the car. 

The vehicle detection algorithms/models can recoginize motorised vehicles such as cars, trucks, in both day and night conditions.

The pedestrian detection algorithms can recoginize moving people or static people stood with some specific postures.


*Note: For some reason I cannot provide all my xml classifier configuration files.*
